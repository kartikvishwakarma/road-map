# road-map
implementation of client server architecture (C++) for querying an road map stored in a data base system. The server is storing a the road map of a city (modeled as a graph) in disk pages simulated as files in my program. Clients would be querying this map through a simple get neighbors query. This query will take the following inputs: (a) source node, (b) number of neighbors (k). I have  wrote a BFS code which starts at this source node and returns the first k node ids found in the graph representation of the road map. Note that BFS may span across different pages. I have partition graph using two method (1) uniform partiton (2) BFS partition.
